# You can use substitution rules to tweak the way espeak* will say
# certain words; this can help, e.g., if you are not satisfied
# with the results of the default text-to-speech-conversion
# algorithm. For example:

# Ensure the initial 'e' in efabulor is pronounced as in e-mail:

efabulor
ee fabulor

# You can also use substitution rules to replace any text whatsoever,
# according to your needs. If you are planning to use efabulor as a
# proofreading tool, be careful with this kind of substitutions, as you
# no longer can assume that what you hear is what is written in the
# input file:

99.99% sure
confident enough

# Another potential use is to help you detect typos. For example,
# the following rule will help you spot double-spaces within sentences.
# (Using regular expressions as substitution rules is fine.)

s/\s{2,}/ double space /


# * Remember that the actual speaking is not done by efabulor, which is
#   only a wrapper around espeak.
