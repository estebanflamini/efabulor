# Contributing to xpeak

If you want to contribute to this project, you're welcome! I'll give credit to anyone contributing to this project. Some potential contributions:
- This program was developed and tested under Linux-Debian 10. It should work in other Linux distros (and perhaps Mac). Some lines of code were added here and there to make it run in Windows, but it hasn't been thoroughly tested. You can contribute to this project by testing it in different platforms and letting me know if you get in trouble. (And perhaps helping me make any necessary changes.)
- The current version only supports **espeak**. Support for other speech-synthesis engines might be desirable.
- The program's interface is written in English. You are welcome to localize it. The program uses ``gettext`` for all of its localizable strings. Please refer to ``gettext`` in _The Python Library Reference_.
- New features might be added, existing ones can be improved; suggestions are welcome.
