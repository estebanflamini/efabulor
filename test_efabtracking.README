For the time being, only a test suite for the efabtracking module
is provided.* It uses a brute-force approach of testing the output
of the principal function in that module against an assorted set of
inputs.** Individual tests are not reported as they run, and the
testing suite will fail and exit at the first failed test if any.

To run the test:

python3 test_efabtracking.py

(Be sure to have test_efabtracking.py in the same directory as all
the efab*py files.)

This is Work-In-Progress. I expect to add testing suites for other
modules, using standard tools such as the unittest library.

------------------------------------------------------------------

* The efabtracking module provides an important part of efabulor's
functionality, and its output depends in  complex ways on its inputs,
so it was a good place to start adding tests.

** The test takes around 15 seconds in a reasonably fast computer.
